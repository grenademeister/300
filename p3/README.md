# Mask2Former + U-Net (SegFormer-style) Ensemble for Pixel-wise Segmentation

Implemented an ensemble pipeline combining Mask2Former (instance-aware transformer segmentation) and a U-Net/SegFormer-style encoderâ€“decoder network to improve pixel-level accuracy and boundary precision on aerial imagery.

execute `Mak2Former.ipynb` and `Unet.ipynb` to train and validate each model. execute `Mask2Former+Unet.ipynb` to ensemble these two models.
